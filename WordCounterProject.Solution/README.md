# WordCounter

#### Application where it counts how frequent the word is used in a sentence

#### By **Victoria Martinez**

## Description

Program that gathers both a word and sentence from a user, then checks how frequently the word appears in the sentence. It should check for full word matches only. (For instance, if provided the word "cat" and sentence "I'm walking to the cathedral." the first three letters of the word cathedral would not be counted.)

Build out an MVC web user interface for the Word Counter application you built in last week's independent project. You should clone your repo from last week and use the same git log.
